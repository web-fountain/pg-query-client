If you are using a CDN, disable any automatic compression for
the woff2 files (they are already compressed) and set the
following HTTP headers for the woff2 files:

  Content-Type: font/woff2
  Cache-Control: max-age=31536000

The CSS contains specific version information in the URLs used
to load the fonts, so this is safe for upgrading to newer
versions of Inter.
